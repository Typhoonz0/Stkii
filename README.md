Meet stkii, the coolest terminal-based note taking app
# Features
Stkii makes creating, viewing, and editing sticky notes with ease. Its simple interface makes the user feel right at home. You can colour the text, and bold it!

Make sure you have Python installed, then either run the .exe file, or download the raw source code and run it. It's that easy!
# Why Stkii
Other note taking apps take notes on you and your habits. With stkii, you can be relaxed knowing we aren't doing anything sneaky with your PC or data.
